			<h2>Chapter 3: Understanding Credit Scores</h2>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the basics of credit scores and why they are important. We will discuss what makes up a credit score, how to check your credit score, and provide tips on how to improve your score.</p>
			<h3>What is a Credit Score?</h3>
			<p>A credit score is a three-digit number that represents your creditworthiness. It is used by lenders, banks, and credit card companies to determine whether or not to extend credit to you. The higher your credit score, the more likely you are to be approved for credit and to receive favorable interest rates and terms.</p>
			<h3>What Makes Up a Credit Score?</h3>
			<p>There are several factors that make up a credit score:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Payment history</li>
				<li>Credit utilization</li>
				<li>Length of credit history</li>
				<li>New credit</li>
				<li>Credit mix</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>How to Check Your Credit Score</h3>
			<p>You can check your credit score for free once a year from each of the three major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. You can also check your score for free through various online services.</p>
			<h3>Improving Your Credit Score</h3>
			<p>Improving your credit score takes time and effort, but it is possible. Here are some tips to help you improve your score:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Pay your bills on time</li>
				<li>Keep your credit utilization low</li>
				<li>Don't close old credit accounts</li>
				<li>Avoid opening too many new credit accounts</li>
				<li>Check your credit report for errors and dispute them</li>
			</ul>
